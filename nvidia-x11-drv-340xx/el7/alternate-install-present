** ATTENTION **

An RPM packaged version of the NVIDIA driver from elrepo.org is already
installed on this system. If you wish to install the NVIDIA driver using
the NVIDIA installer you MUST first uninstall the RPM packaged version of
the driver. To uninstall the packaged version of the driver, please run:

rpm -e kmod-nvidia

or

yum erase kmod-nvidia

and then reboot your system. It is then safe to run the NVIDIA installer.
