** ATTENTION **

An RPM packaged version of the NVIDIA driver from elrepo.org is already
installed on this system. If you wish to install the NVIDIA driver using
the NVIDIA installer you MUST first uninstall the RPM packaged version of
the driver. To uninstall the packaged version of the driver, please run:

rpm -e kmod-nvidia-340xx

or

yum erase kmod-nvidia-340xx

and then reboot your system. It is then safe to run the NVIDIA installer.
