NOTE: This module is not functioning yet !!!

This is a backport attempt for kernel module pch_gbe from kernel 2.6.39.3
to RHEL-5.7 (kernel-2.6.18-274.el5).

For compilation, additionally the file include/linux/ethtool.h of
the RHEL-5.7 kernel sources was modified. So before calling make, the
modified ethtool.h in the subdir of this tree should be copied in
place.

To date, all modules apart from pch_gbe_main.c build cleanly.
