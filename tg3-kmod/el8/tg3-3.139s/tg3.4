.SH DESCRIPTION
.I tg3
is the network device driver for the Broadcom
.B NetXtreme BCM57xx
series PCI/PCI-X/PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Network Interface Card (NIC).
The latest driver is in the latest 3.x Linux kernel. It can also be
downloaded from http://www.broadcom.com as a source package, but is
generally not necessary to do so if you are using the latest 3.x
upstream kernel from http://www.kernel.org or one of the latest
vendor kernels from Red Hat, SuSE, or others.
.PP
Refer to the README.TXT from the driver package on how to
compile and install the driver source package.
.PP
Refer to various Linux documentations
on how to configure network protocol and address.

.\" DRIVER SETTINGS part
.\"
.SH DRIVER SETTINGS
Driver settings can be queried and changed using \fBethtool\fP. The latest
ethtool can be downloaded from
\fBftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/network/ethtool\fP if
it is not already installed. 
See the ethtool man page for more information. ethtool settings
do not persist across reboot or module reload. The ethtool commands can be
put in a startup script such as /etc/rc.local to preserve the settings
across a reboot. On Red Hat distributions, "ethtool -s" parameters can be
specified in the ifcfg-ethx scripts using the ETHTOOL_OPTS keyword. The
specified ethtool parameters will be set during ifup. Example:
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:

ETHTOOL_OPTS="wol g speed 100 duplex half autoneg off"

.\" DEFAULT SETTINGS part
.\"
.SH DEFAULT SETTINGS
.TP
Speed :
Autonegotiation with all speeds advertised
.TP
Flow control :
Autonegotiation with rx and tx advertised
.TP
MTU :
1500 (range 46 - 9000)

Some chips do not support jumbo MTUs bigger than 1500

.TP
Rx Ring Size :
200 (range 0 - 511)
.TP
Rx Jumbo Ring Size :
100 (range 0 - 255)

Not all chips support the jumbo ring, and some
chips that support jumbo frames do not use the
jumbo ring.

.TP
Tx Ring Size :
511 (range (MAX_SKB_FRAGS+1) - 511)

MAX_SKB_FRAGS varies on different kernels and
different architectures. On a 2.6/3.x kernel for
x86, MAX_SKB_FRAGS is 18.

.TP
Number of RSS channels:
Varies depending on the number of CPUs on MSI-X
capable devices.  (Range 1 - 4)

.TP
Number of TSS channels:
Varies depending on the number of CPUs on MSI-X
capable devices.  (Range 1 - 4)

.TP
Coalesce rx usecs :
20 (range 0 - 1023)
.TP
Coalesce rx usecs irq :
20 (range 0 - 255)
.TP
Coalesce rx frames :
5 (range 0 - 1023)
.TP
Coalesce rx frames irq :

.TP
Coalesce tx frames irq :
5 (range 0 - 255)
.TP
Coalesce stats usecs   :
1000000 (aprox. 1 sec.)

Some coalescing parameters are not used or have
different defaults on some chips

.TP
MSI/MSI-X :
Enabled (if supported by the device and interrupt test passes)
.TP
TSO :
Enabled on 2.6/3.x kernels on newer devices
(Some devices do not support TSO)
.TP
WoL :
Disabled

.\" SENSOR SUPPORT part
.\"
.SH SENSOR SUPPORT
If your device and platform support sensors and you're running a
kernel that supports CONFIG_HWMON, you can read the sensor data from:

/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon#/device/

Select the hwmon# device that matches the tg3 device.  Only
\fBtemp1\fP sensor attributes are supported at this time.
