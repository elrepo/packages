NOTE: This module is not functioning yet !!!

This is a backport attempt for kernel module pch_gbe from kernel 2.6.38
to 2.6.18-238 (RHEL5 kernel). As far as implemented, the module is
being built against 2.6.18-238, but in fact when insmod'ding it, a
kernel panic is the result.
The modified code in this tree is marked with comments "WN mod".

For compilation, additionally the file include/linux/netdevice.h of
the 2.6.18 kernel sources was modified. So before calling make, the
modified netdevice.h in the subdir of this tree should be copied in
place.

Before testing, the module mii has to be loaded, because pch_gbe is
based on it.
When insmod'ding the binary module, the resulting call trace of the
kernel panic looks about like this:

pch_gbe_probe
__driver_attach
pci_device_probe
driver_probe_device
__driver_attach
bus_for_each_dev
driver_attach
bus_add_driver
__pci_register_driver
pch_gbe_init_module
sys_init_module
mii_ethtool_gdet
dput
syscall
