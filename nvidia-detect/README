nvidia-detect - a utility to detect NVIDIA graphics cards

nvidia-detect is a utility to detect NVIDIA graphics cards. The utility will
probe the PCI bus for NVIDIA devices and search for matching devices against a
list of supported device_ids. nvidia-detect will make a recommendation for the
correct driver to use based on any matches found. For example:

$ nvidia-detect
kmod-nvidia

Because nvidia-detect outputs the package name on RHEL based systems, it may be
used in the following way to install the correct NVIDIA driver for your system:

# yum install $(nvidia-detect)


More verbose output is availabe using the verbose (-v) switch, for example:

$ nvidia-detect -v
Probing for supported NVIDIA devices...
[10de:1d01] NVIDIA Corporation GP108 [GeForce GT 1030]
This device requires the current 550.127.05 NVIDIA driver kmod-nvidia

$ nvidia-detect -v
Probing for supported NVIDIA devices...
[10de:1287] NVIDIA Corporation GK208 [GeForce GT 730]
This device requires the legacy 470.xx NVIDIA driver kmod-nvidia

$ nvidia-detect -v
Probing for supported NVIDIA devices...
[10de:0ca3] NVIDIA Corporation GT215 [GeForce GT 240]
This device requires the legacy 340.xx NVIDIA driver kmod-nvidia-340xx

$ nvidia-detect -v
Probing for supported NVIDIA devices...
[10de:0392] NVIDIA Corporation G73 [GeForce 7600 GS]
This device requires the legacy 304.xx NVIDIA driver kmod-nvidia-304xx


nvidia-detect will also check compatibility between the detected devices
recommended driver and the current Xorg Server. The Xorg compatibility tests
are always performed and compatibility information is displayed if run with the
--xorg (-x) command line argument:

$ nvidia-detect -vx
Probing for supported NVIDIA devices...
[10de:1287] NVIDIA Corporation GK208 [GeForce GT 730]
This device requires the legacy 470.xx NVIDIA driver kmod-nvidia

Checking ABI compatibility with Xorg Server...
Xorg Video Driver ABI detected: 19
ABI compatibility check passed

$ nvidia-detect --xorg
kmod-nvidia-340xx

Checking ABI compatibility with Xorg Server...
Xorg Video Driver ABI detected: 13
ABI compatibility check passed


nvidia-detect may be run from within a script and will return the following codes:

0: No supported devices found
1: Device supported by the current 550.127.05 NVIDIA driver
2: Device supported by the legacy 96.xx NVIDIA driver
3: Device supported by the legacy 173.xx NVIDIA driver
4: Device supported by the legacy 304.xx NVIDIA driver
5: Device supported by the legacy 340.xx NVIDIA driver
6: Device supported by the legacy 367.xx NVIDIA driver
7: Device supported by the legacy 390.xx NVIDIA driver
8: Device supported by the legacy 470.xx NVIDIA driver
